Does the hand analysis agree with program?

The physical calculation and program match up:

a) Find the shortest distance between ORD and LAX.
	ORD → DFW → LAX

b) Find the shortest distance between JFK and SFO.
	JFK → ORD → SFO 

c) Find the minimum spanning tree.
	Minimum Spanning Tree Edges:
		JFK - BOS: 189
		SFO - LAX: 338
		ORD - JFK: 743
		ORD - DFW: 803
		JFK - MIA: 1093
		LAX - DFW: 1234

Total Minimum Spanning Tree Weight: 4400
