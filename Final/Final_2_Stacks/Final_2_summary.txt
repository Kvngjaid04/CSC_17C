Compare table output values to input

What do you see? 
	The number of function calls increases rapidly as the input angle moves away from zero. This growth shows a pattern that closely matches Fibonacci numbers.
and why?
	This happens because the algorithm recalculates the same intermediate values over and over without storing them.

What does Theory say about recursions?
	Recursive algorithms without memorization that have overlapping subproblems exhibit exponential time complexity, and when each call branches into two subcalls, the growth pattern naturally follows the Fibonacci sequence where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
