How does the static compare to the random? Why so different?
	The static mode runs with fixed, predictable arrival and service times, every customer arrives exactly every 15 seconds, and each clerk takes a fixed time (60, 120, or 80 seconds) to serve a customer. Because of this consistency, the system reaches a steady state where wait times and queue lengths remain stable and predictable.
	On the other hand, the random mode introduces variability by adjusting both arrival intervals and service times by Â±50%. This randomness makes the system less predictable and leads to periods where customers arrive in large/small quantities or clerks take longer/shorter to finish service. Because the arrival and service rates fluctuate, the queue can sometimes grow unexpectedly large, and customers can wait longer. This results in a higher average wait time and a max queue in the simulation.
